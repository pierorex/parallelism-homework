    - As we can see, just by taking away the accumulation in an array position
      and doing it in a 'result' variable gives us an improvement 
      of ~2.5 seconds.
    - By increasing the number of threads to 2, we improved ~1.4 seconds, due
      to the utilization of both cores in my machine.
    - While we increase the number of threads used above 2, OpenMP can't help 
      us any further because the system only has 2 cores, thus any extra 
      threads will be forcing cores sharing, which inevitably causes 
      bottlenecks.
    - Parallelization is a good fit for this problem as we can run expensive
      operations in different threads.
